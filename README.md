## Winget (Better than Ninite)

Terminal application manager for windows. If you don't want to bother too much with the terminal

1. Go to [winstall.app](https://winstall.app) and add as many apps as you want.
2. Click generate script, select powershell, copy the code.
3. Open powershell and copy paste. 
 
 I have my script saved on a notepad incase I have to reset windows or set up a new PC, turns something that takes hours into something that takes minutes.

# [Mica For Everyone (Better Than Windows)](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone/releases)

Adds Black/White Titlebars based on your theme choice or manual choice. Using Mica causes artifcats for now but that's on MS apparently.
